underAmpersDescrioption=<html> \
<li>Each of yours leds contains of three subleds - red, green and blue</li> \
<li>to shine eg. red, only red sub-diod is glowing.</li> \
<li>to shine eg. yellow, red and green sub-diods are glowing.</li> \
<li>to shine white, all three sub-diods are glowing.</li> \
<li>The LED is usually having 0.06A-0.18A consumption (== three sub-diods per 0.02-0.06A) on maximum white shine.</li> \
<li>eg red glowing on 50% will be consuming only 0.01-0.03A!</li> \
<li>Above, brightness is the intensity of shining (0-254 for 0-100%)</li> \
You see the sub parts of each color above? That is the sub diods handling. And that is used also to protect your leds. \
If you have lack of power, it is recommended to run only pure red and green and blue individually. <br> \
To run all diods white on max you need usually very strong powersource (simple calc: 100leds =~ 10-20A!) <br> \
If you demand more power then you have, for longer time, you will destroy your leds<br> \
<li>To carry more then 10A in wires, requires very solid wires.</li> \
<li>It is recommended to connect weaker source periodically</li> \
Two examples: \
<li>1) Small 12 diods board, 0.18A each, ONE 2A powersource</li> \
<li> - Maximum consumption (12 white on max) is 2.18A </li> \
<li> - avarage consumption (3 single-subled, 3 white, all  50%) 0.5(3*0.06+3*0.18)=0.36A!</li> \
<li> - No need to act, the  underpower control will act only on full brightness of 11 or 12 leds. </li> \
<li> - In that case, It will lower the shine of all diods by 0.91 and that is not-noticable </li> \
<li>2) Larger 400 diods wall, 0.18A each, FOUR 10A powersources (one per 100 LEDs)</li> \
<li> - Maximum consumption of indepndently charged strip of 100 leds is 18A </li> \
<li> - that is bad, if more then  half will be on full throtle, the protector will be lowering shine of this strip, to nearly 0.5 for all 100</li> \
<li> - however, you can hapily shine all 100 leds to 50% (9A) or you can shine 100% of all 100 of single red or green or blue (5-6A)</li> \
<li> - Or you can  divide the max shine so the 100 leds are shining over four stipes - then each powersource will be drawn by 4.5A only </li> \

tip1=ctrl is doing really a lot:
tip2= eg. selects individual boulders (in Select boulder)
tip3= eg. allows direct jump to boulder (via << < > >>)
tip4= Shift in boulder selection selects range
tip5=Save only extraordinary boulders. Random shots keep only for runtime session
tip6=Once boulder s created, you can not modify it. so don't be harsh. (well, it can, but...)
tips7=Boulder must have at least one hold
tips8=No limitation on number of start-holds or top-holds
tips9=No top-hold is top on edge
tips10=you have no limitation on length of boulder, only to long boulders will dim
